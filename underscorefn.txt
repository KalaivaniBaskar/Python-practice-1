all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed. Functions and
classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets ran.
Unlike other languages, there's no main() function that gets run automatically
- the main() function is implicitly all the code at the top level.

In this case, the top-level code is an if block.  __name__ is a built-in variable
 which evaluate to the name of the current module. However, if a module is being
 run directly (as in myscript.py above), then __name__ instead is set to the
 string "__main__". Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly
  or being imported by something else by testing

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        ...

If that code is being imported into another module, the various function and
class definitions will be imported, but the main() code won't get run
